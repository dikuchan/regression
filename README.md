# Regression

Various optimization methods for linear regression implemented from scratch.

See [model.ipynb](./model.ipynb).

### About

Course assignment @ St. Petersburg State University.

Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp).

### Methods

- [x] Mini-batch stochastic gradient descent
- [x] AdaGrad
- [x] RMSProp
- [x] Adam

With regularization:

- [x] Lasso
- [x] Ridge
